-  all parties attended and hosted by a user
-  the name and artist of all songs loaded into a party through the
selection of one of the host user's playlists

energy, which is used to generate user-specific statistics

several hundred students), they will need to upgrade their account to
a premium plan. **SpotifyParty collects the following additional data
for premium users:**

## Information Usage

#### Listening Habits

Top artists, top genres, and song attribute information about each
user are stored based on the songs they vote for and request, and the
parties they attend. All of this collected information is used only
for the display of the interactive graphs on a user's dashboard page.

#### Payment Information

Credit card information is stored securely and is used solely for
providing the convenience of automatic billing. Users can specify
during the initial upgrade of their account whether or not to not
store credit card information. Furthermore, users can request to have
their cards on file deleted at any time.

#### Contact Information

The only contact information collected by SpotifyParty is your name
and email address. This data will be used to send post-event summaries
of each party you host or attend. It will also be used to send a
monthly recap of all your events for the month, along with an update
on the progress of your impact score. For premium users, your email
address will be used to send receipts of payments.

Included at the bottom of each email will be a request for users to
spread the word about our application. However, users can opt out of
receiving emails at any time and can see all of the same information
directly through their dashboard.

#### Survey Responses

SpotifyParty will create occasional, optional, and anonymous surveys
that can be completed in roughly 1-2 minutes directly through our
site. These surveys give users the option to provide feedback on our
application so we can continuously improve. While the responses to
these surveys are stored, they are anonymous and will not be linked
directly to any user account.

#### Employment Information

The collection of employer and occupation information for premium
users is used by SpotifyParty strictly for informative purposes, and
is optional. We value learning what our customers are using our app
for.

## Third Party Applications

SpotifyParty makes use of external APIs provided by the music
streaming service Spotify. Most host user actions during an active
party require authentication with a valid Spotify account. During the
authorization process, SpotifyParty requests access to several scopes
surround a user's account that provide access to the following:

- read data from a user's playlists, both public and private view a
- user's active Spotify device IDs for directing playback requests
- control a user's playback functionality, specifically play, pause,
- skip, and adding to the playback queue search the Spotify library on
behalf of the user

The Spotify credentials of SpotifyParty's users are handled directly
via Spotify's authorization flow and are not seen, nor stored, by
SpotifyParty itself. *If, and only if, the user approves our requested
scopes, the user-specific information stored by SpotifyParty is:*


1) An access token provided to us by Spotify during the authorization
process, which we store and use in every subsequent request to
Spotify's API on behalf of the user.
2) The Spotify identification code of the user's most recent
playback-supported device.

***NOTE: This information only persists in our database for the
duration of the current party the user is hosting. As soon as the
party is ended, the access token and device ID are removed from our
records.***
