## Privacy Policy Justification Worksheet

1. Briefly describe the website you built for the project (its
purpose/functionality/etc.)

   The website we built for this project is an app that lets people
   host parties with music controlled through Spotify's API. Hosts can
   take input from party attendees on what songs should be played next
   based on requests and votes on queued songs.

   Based on user actions, such as hosting/attending parties and voting
   for and requesting songs, we graphically display user stats, such
   as top artists and genres, and impact score.

2. Identify the stakeholders (direct and indirect) whose interests are
relevant to your website.

   Our primary direct stakeholders are DJs for events like proms,
   homecomings, and weddings, who want a quick, easy, and convenient
   way to manage requests.  Currently, making a request to a DJ
   requires an attendee going up to the DJ booth, screaming in the DJs
   ear, which they may or may not remember, or writing their song
   request down on a piece of paper. With our app, DJs can share the
   party code, which enables any attendees to join and vote for their
   favorite songs from  a pool of music determined by the DJs
   playlists, and also directly request their favorite songs by
   specifying its name and artist.

   Our secondary intended users/stakeholders are high school and
   college students who host parties and want a fun and collaborative
   way to determine the music for the evening, as well as have a
   friendly competition with their friends to see who can level up the
   fastest (based on impact score).

   Other indirect stakeholders would include Spotify itself, who
   profits from users interacting with their application, as well as
   third-party companies such as concert/artist promoters who value
   learning about the listening habits of music consumers, although we
   do not currently share any of this relevant data with
   third-parties, as clearly expressed in my privacy policy.

3. What data will you have access to, and what might this data reveal
about its subjects?

   The primary data we have access to, other than user's names and
   email addresses, is the listening habits of all users. We keep
   track of the songs each user voted for and requested in order to
   display their top artists and genres, as well as the audio features
   of the tracks they seem to like (e.g. danceabilty rating, valence
   (happiness), energy, and loudness).

   For premium users (users who want to host a party with 10 or more
   attendees), we collect credit card information (but only store it
   if user's opt in to auto-billing), and we also collect the
   occupation of the user, their employer, and their main reasons for
   using our app.

   The data we collect therefore reveals music preferences of each
   user, as well as some of their current employment information. The
   later is used just internally to see what use cases within which
   professions our app's users have found for our app. The former
   could be used, in a future version of our app, to target ads about
   concerts and music releases to our users, as it shows what artists
   and songs a user has been listening to most frequently.

4. What values are relevant to your website and its privacy policy?
(Note that the relevant values will depend in part on the kind of
website you are building).

  The values relevant to our website's privacy policy are primarily
  user contact information, payment information (for premium users),
  and the listening habits or each user (determined from the songs
  they vote  on and request). While our website tracks additional data
  including the number of parties hosted and attended by a user, the
  metadata of songs added to a party's queue, and the impact score of
  each user, these are not as relevant to user's privacy as they do
  not reveal any private or otherwise sensitive data about a user. I
  still mentioned all of these data collection points in the privacy
  policy, but provide much greater detail about the more relevant
  values by providing details on what we do with those data points.

  It is important to note that all user-specific values can  be viewed
  by the user at any time on their dashboard. We do not hide any
  relevant collected data points from the users.

5. What counts as “success” for the website you are building?

  We would consider a "success" to be acquiring regular users,
  specifically real DJs, who benefit from having a streamlined system
  for taking  input from their party attendees.

  In terms of data, success would include collecting informative data
  from our users through the occasional surveys we will send out,
  and/or through the upgrading process to a premium account. This
  information will allow us to improve our site in the future.  

  Eventually, success will include the ability to monetize a larger
  percentage of users and attract users from across the country
  through word-of-mouth or the potential future advertisement of our
  services.

6. Describe how you took the relevant values into account in writing
your privacy policy (e.g. what decisions and tradeoffs were made, and
why).

  User listening habits are the most detailed data points we collect,
  so I mention it first and foremost in the Information Usage section.
  I determined that the collection of song metadata for these purposes
  is reasonable and is not personal enough to deter users from using
  our app, so there would be no issues clearly stating our usage of
  this information upfront.

  I decided to mention our usage of payment information second, as
  this data is also very sensitive to users. I state that our app
  processes this information but only stores it if the user opts in to
  auto billing at the beginning of each payment cycle. Furthermore, I
  state that users can  have their credit card information deleted at
  any time.

  Furthermore, I decided to include sections about what we do with
  survey results and the employment information we collect when a
  user upgrades to a premium account. I mentioned that we use this
  data only to make improvements to our app and to see what our app is
  being used for. I also mention clearly that these forms are
  optional and the user surveys are anonymous. While we appreciate
  users who provide this information, we chose not not to require it
  out of respect for our user's right to privacy.

  Additional considerations:

  We could have decided to track user's browser cookies and/or the
  websites that they navigated to our app from, in order to embed
  advertisements in our website to further monetize it. We also could
  have chosen to share user listening data to companies that want to
  target ads for concerts or music releases to specific people.
  However, we decided, out of respect for user's privacy, to only use
  user statistics internally for data visualization purposes.

  Furthermore, especially at a fancy event like a prom or wedding,
  hosts and attendees alike would expect a sleek user interface free
  from annoying ads if they were to vote for or request a song. While
  one day we may make an advertisement display distinction between
  regular and premium user accounts, for now we are not tracking,
  collecting, or selling ad-related user data.

  Our choice to not track this data is reflected in the privacy
  policy.
